There was once a young boi named gengu. He was a ninja, but not just any ordinary ninja. He was a cyborg ninja. He had spent a lot of his free time learning martial arts. When he grew up, he joined the elite task force "Overwatch".

Scientists, Soldiers, Adventurers, Oddities. Overwatch was created to protect the world from the Omnic Crisis and its aftermath. Gengu was a part of this organization. And he always needed healing.
